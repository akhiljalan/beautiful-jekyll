In this project, my team and I sought to build a classifier to predict the success or failure of a terrorist attack. In addition to building three different classifiers (random forests, neural networks, and LASSO regression), we created map GPS visualizations (credit to Yakub) and heatmaps to roughly quantify similarity of terrorist networks, attack types, and region. 

This was my captsone project for a class in Fall 2017 (Statistics 159).
