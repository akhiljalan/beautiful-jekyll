**Abstract**: The abelian sandpile model is a discrete dynamical system defined on a graph, in which grains of “sand” are placed on the vertices and move along edges. Despite its simple combinatorial description, the sandpile model has surprising connections to a variety of areas, including spectral graph theory, finite group theory, computational complexity, and more. I survey some of these connections through the lens of the sandpile group, a finite abelian group associated to a graph, whose elements can be identified with recurrent states of the sandpile model. After presenting various equivalent formulations of the sandpile group, I focus on a particular description of the sandpile group, as the cokernel of the graph Laplacian matrix. Under this description, it is (in principle) easy to compute the invariant factor decompositon of the sandpile group, by computing the Smith Normal Form of the reduced Laplacian matrix. Using this technique, I study the invariant factors of the sandpile groups for various families of graphs, especially expanders. I prove lower bounds on the number of trivial invariant factors for families of graphs, such as the hypercube and grid graphs. For more interesting graph families, such as two explicit constructions of expanders, I 	 formulate conjectures about their invariant factors on the base of computer experiments.
