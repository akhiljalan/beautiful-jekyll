Hi there! My name Akhil Jalan. 

I'm a 3rd-year student at the University of California, Berkeley studying Applied Mathematics with a concentration in data science. I'm interested in applying machine learing, optimization, and data analysis to solve socially important problems. You can view some of my projects [here](https://akhiljalan.github.io/projects/), or on my Github.
