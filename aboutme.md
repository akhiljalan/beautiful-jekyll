Hello! This is my professional homepage. 

If you'd like to get in touch, email is the easiest way to reach me: *akhiljalan@berkeley.edu*

I am currently a software engineer at WeWork, in the [Research and Applied Sciences team](https://research.wework.com/).

Previously, I was a student in Applied Mathematics at UC Berkeley. During my time there I worked on various research projects in computer science and mathematics. 

In summer of 2018, I was on a team of 4 Berkeley students who won 2nd place at *The Data Open*, a national data-science style hackathon hosted by Citadel Securities and Correlation One. Our project predicted the effect of weather patterns on flight delays, using data from major US airlines from 2016-2018. 

In spring 2018, I was a finalist in the *Data for Good Competition* hosted by UC Berkeley's Center for Technology, Society, and Policy. My team's project, *"Accountability in the Information Age: A Study of Data Transparency in Local Governments"*, evaluated the accessibility and reliability of governmental data for a variety of cities in California. See the [website](https://ctsp.berkeley.edu/data-for-good-projects/) for more details.
