I am an incoming software engineer at WeWork, in the Research and Applied Sciences team. I am broadly interested in computer science and statistics,

In spring of 2019, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a BA in Applied Mathematics. During my time there I worked on various research projects in computer science and mathematics. 

In summer of 2018, I was on a team of 4 Berkeley students who won 2nd place at *The Data Open*, a national data-science style hackathon hosted by Citadel Securities and Correlation One. Our project predicted the effect of weather patterns on flight delays, using data from major US airlines from 2016-2018. 

In spring 2018, I was a finalist in the Data for Good Competition hosted by UC Berkeley's Center for Technology, Society, and Policy. My team's project, *"Accountability in the Information Age: A Study of Data Transparency in Local Governments"*, evaluated the accessibility and reliability of governmental data for a variety of cities in California. See the [website](https://ctsp.berkeley.edu/data-for-good-projects/) for more details. 

This website is mainly for sharing research, projects, and blog posts. It is currently badly out of date, which I hope to fix this summer. If for some reason you care about what I'm up to or was previously, email is the easiest way to reach me: *akhiljalan@berkeley.edu*
