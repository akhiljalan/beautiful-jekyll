Hi there! My name Akhil Jalan. 

I'm a 3rd-year student at the University of California, Berkeley studying Applied Mathematics with a conentration in machine learning.

### Brief Story of My Life

I grew up in Southern California, where I spent a lot of time playing YuGiOh and re-reading the Harry Potter books (I've read the series through at least 10 times. It's kind of scar). 

From ages 12-18, I spent a lot time in competitive debate, which I consider a formative influence. Debate taught me to appreciate complexity, question everything, and speak articulately. 

Here's a picture of me holding some debate trophies and attempting to smile, circa 2011.

Having learned a bit about world events, I came to Cal in 2015 intending to major in Economics or Political Science. But during first semester, I ended up enjoying the math class I took (an introduction to linear algebra and differential equations) so much that I decided to study math instead. 

Besides the math-y stuff, I've made some great friends and memories in [Effective Altruists of Berkeley](https://www.facebook.com/effectivealtruismberkeley/), a student club about [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/). I've been President of EAB since January 2017.
