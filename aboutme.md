title: About Me

---

I am a 3rd-year undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley studying Applied Mathematics. I'm broadly interested in optimization, machine learning, and statistics, and am concentrating in these subjects in school and research. In addition to being interesting in their own right, these topics have major consequences for societal welfare and equity, and I am actively working on some projects dealing with this. 

Specifically, I am part of Professor Anant Sahai's research group on machine learning approaches to wireless communications. I am also working with Professor Gireeja Ranade's team on evaluating fairness metrics in the facility location problem. 

Aside from research, I am in the seed grant phase of the Data for Good Competition hosted by UC Berkeley's Center for Technology, Society, and Policy. My team's project, *"Accountability in the Information Age: A Study of Data Transparency in Local Governments"*, seeks to evaluate the accessibility and reliability of governmental data for a variety of cities in California. See the [website](https://ctsp.berkeley.edu/data-for-good-projects/) for more details.
