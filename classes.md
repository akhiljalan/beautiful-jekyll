Here are all of the classes I've taken at UC Berkeley which relate to programming, statistics, or math in some way. I've shared some thoughts on each, so that this hopefully serves as a useful resource to other Cal students. I'm happy to answer your questions over email or in the comments. 

Some other resources 
* [The r/Berkeley subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/)
* [The BerkeleyTime catalogue](http://www.berkeleytime.com/catalog/)
* For EECS classes specifically, the EECS 101 Piazza class. If you're a CS or EECS major at Cal, you should have acess to this. 

## Mathematics

* **Math 113 - Introduction to Abstract Algebra**
	* Professor(s): Silvain Rideau
	* Difficulty (out of 5): 3
	* Thoughts: I really enjoyed the material in this class. Abstract algebra is such a rich and deep subject that I only wish we could have covered more. I thought the class and homeworks were pretty reasonable - right around the middle of the pack in terms of courses I've taken. 
	* Term: Spring 2016

* **Math 185 - Introduction to Complex Analysis**
	* Professor(s): Andrey Smirnov
	* Difficulty (out of 5): 
	* Thoughts:
	* Term: Spring 2016

* **Math 128A - Numerical Analysis**
	* Professor(s): Olga Holtz
	* Difficulty (out of 5): 
	* Thoughts:
	* Term: Spring 2016

* **Math 104 - Introduction to Analysis**
	* Professor(s): Michael Pejic
	* Difficulty (out of 5): 
	* Thoughts:
	* Term: Spring 2016

* **Math 110 - Linear Algebra**
	* Professor(s): Edward Frenkel
	* Difficulty (out of 5): 
	* Thoughts:
	* Term: Spring 2016

* **Math 53 - Multivariable Calculus**
	* Professor(s): Denis Auroux
	* Difficulty (out of 5): 
	* Thoughts:
	* Term: Spring 2016

* **Math 55 - Discrete Mathematics**
	* Professor(s): Nikhil Srivastava
	* Difficulty (out of 5): 
	* Thoughts:
	* Term: Spring 2016

* **Math 54 - Linear Algebra and Differential Equations**
	* Professor(s): David Nadler
	* Difficulty (out of 5): 
	* Thoughts:
	* Term: Fall 2015

## Statistics 

* **Stat 159/259 - Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science**
	* Professor(s): Fernando Perez
	* Difficulty (out of 5): 2. 
	* Thoughts: This was a fairly relaxed introduction to some useful programming tools for data science. We covered the basics of Python programming, some common packages (NumPy, Matplotlib), and had three projects. I particularly enjoyed my final project, in which my team used a variety of ML techniques to predict the success of terrorist attacks. 
	* [Course Website](https://berkeley-stat159-f17.github.io/stat159-f17/)
	* Term: Fall 2017

* **Stat 150: Stochastic Processes** 

* **Stat 135 - Concepts of Statistics** 
	* Professor(s): Hermann Helmut Pitters
	* Difficulty (out of 5): 
	* Thoughts:
	* Term: Fall 2016

* **Stat 134 - Concepts of Probability** 
	* Professor(s): Hermann Helmut Pitters
	* Difficulty (out of 5): 
	* Thoughts:
	* Term: Spring 2017


## Computer Science 

* **CS 189/289 - Introduction to Machine Learning**
	* Professor(s): Anant Sahai, Stella Yu
	* Difficulty (out of 5): 4.5
	* Thoughts: This was probably the most difficult class I've taken at Cal. The class moved really fast, covering a whirlwind of topics of machine learning and statistics. I learned a lot of programming and theory, but spent ridiculous amounts of time on the weekly problem sets and programming assignments. I'm not sure how much of this is because of the nature of the class, and how much is due to Professor Sahai, who is famously challenging. 
	* Resources: The [course website](http://www.eecs189.org/) is for the current iteration of the class. However, the head TA has the materials from the fall 2017 iteration of CS 189 at his website [here](http://alvinwan.com/cs189/fa17/).
	* Term: Fall 2017

* **CS 170 - Algorithms**
	* Professor(s): Prasad Raghavendra, Sanjam Garg
	* Difficulty (out of 5): 4
	* Thoughts: Challenging, but really fun. The class introduced us to a sample of core conepts in algorithmic CS, such as graph theory, dynamic programming, linear programming, etc. There was a strong emphasis on making *fast* algorithms - by the end, I had much better intuition about time complexity. I wish the class was more rigorous, and that we discussed space complexity more.
	* Resources: The course website was private. We followed the [textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Sanjoy-Dasgupta/dp/0073523402) pretty closely. 
	* Term: Spring 2017

* **CS 61B - Data Structures**
	* Professor(s): Paul Hilfinger
	* Difficulty (out of 5): 
	* Thoughts:
	* Term: Fall 2016

* **CS 61A - The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**
	* Professor(s): Brian Hou, Marvin Zhang
	* Difficulty (out of 5): 
	* Thoughts:
	* Term: Summer 2016

* **CS 194 - Deep Neural Networks**
	* Term: Spring 2018 (Currently)
