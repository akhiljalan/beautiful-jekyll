title: Classes at Cal
subtitle: 
---

Here are all of the classes I've taken at UC Berkeley which relate to programming, statistics, or math in some way. I've shared some thoughts on each, so that this hopefully serves as a useful resource to other Cal students. I'm happy to answer your questions over email or in the comments. 

Work in progress...

Some other resources 
* [The r/Berkeley subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/)
* [The BerkeleyTime catalogue](http://www.berkeleytime.com/catalog/)
* For EECS classes specifically, the EECS 101 Piazza class. If you're a CS or EECS major at Cal, you should have acess to this. 

Abbreviations I'll use: 
CS = Computer Science 
Stat = Statistics 
Math = Mathematics

## Spring 2018

These are classes I'm currently taking. I'll write up thoughts at the end of the semester. 

* **Info 190 - Data Mining and Analytics**: 
* **CS 194 - Deep Neural Networks**: 
* **Stat 150: Stochastic Processes**: 


## Fall 2017

* **Stat 159/259 - Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science**
** Professor(s): Fernando Perez
** Difficulty (out of 5): 2. 
** Thoughts: This was a fairly relaxed introduction to some useful programming tools for data science. We covered the basics of Python programming, some common packages (NumPy, Matplotlib), and had three projects. I particulary enjoyed my final project, in which my team used a variety of ML techniques to predict the success of terrorist attacks. 

* **CS 189/289 - Introduction to Machine Learning**
** Professor(s): Anant Sahai, Stella Yu
** Difficulty (out of 5): 4.5
** Thoughts: This was probably the most difficult class I've taken at Cal. The class moved really fast, covering a whirlwind of topics of machine learning and statistics. I learned a lot of programming and theory, but spent ridiculous amounts of time on the weekly problem sets and programming assignments. I'm not sure how much of this is because of the nature of the class, and how much is due to Professor Sahai, who is famously challenging. 

## Spring 2017

* **CS 170 - Algorithms**
** Professor(s): Anant Sahai, Stella Yu
** Difficulty (out of 5): 4.5
